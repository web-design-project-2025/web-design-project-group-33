            Welcome to Movie Roast, where we pop the corn, lower the standards,
            and dive face-first into the steaming dumpster fire of cinema's most
            baffling disasters. These aren't movies you <em>should</em> watch,
            they're movies you <em>have</em> to watch. It's like jury duty for
            your eyeballs.

        <h2>1. The Room (2003)</h2>

          It's not just a bad movie, it's a glitch in the Matrix. Written,
          directed, and starring enigma/possible vampire Tommy Wiseau, ‚ÄúThe
          Room‚Äù is what happens when someone with infinite confidence and zero
          talent is handed a film budget. Every line delivery feels like it was
          recorded on a different planet. Plot threads appear and disappear like
          ghosts. And yet, you can't look away. It's Shakespeare by way of alien
          abduction.

        <h2>2. Epic Movie (2007)</h2>

          Proof that "parody" doesn't mean "funny," and "movie" is a term we use
          loosely. "Epic Movie" tries to spoof pop culture like "Scary Movie"
          did, if "Scary Movie" had been lobotomized and edited in MS Paint.
          It's a relentless barrage of unlicensed costume wigs and punchlines
          that trip over themselves before the setup even finishes. Watching
          this film feels like your brain is being pelted with MySpace
          references by someone who just learned what a meme was in 2004.

          Mother Nature saw ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù and said: <em>Hold my tornado.</em> Somehow,
          ‚ÄúSharknado‚Äù is both exactly what you expect and still dumber than you
          imagine. It's raining sharks. From the sky. Because science. Ian
          Ziering surfs the absurd like a washed-up action figure with a
          chainsaw fetish. It's SyFy's crown jewel of chaos, and honestly, we're
          not even mad. We're just confused. And entertained. But mostly
          confused.

          You thought anime adaptations couldn't get worse. You were wrong. This
          movie took one of the most beloved anime universes of all time and
          said, ‚ÄúWhat if we made it boring, whitewashed, and deeply awkward?‚Äù
          Justin Chatwin plays Goku like he's in a teen deodorant commercial.
          The Kamehameha wave is used <em>to light candles</em>. The real
          evolution? Learning to survive 90 minutes of this cinematic faceplant.

        <h2>5. Meet the Spartans (2008)</h2>

        <p>
          Come for the ‚Äú300‚Äù spoof, stay for the cultural references that aged
          like Blockbuster stock. ‚ÄúMeet the Spartans‚Äù feels like a 2000s YouTube
          compilation got greenlit by a studio executive with a concussion.
          There's Britney Spears jokes, Paris Hilton jokes, and an American Idol
          parody that goes on longer than Paula Abdul's relevance. You'll
          cringe. You'll wince. You'll stare blankly as ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù is dragged into
          the town square and publicly executed.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          In 2025, don't waste all your screen time on cinematic perfection.
          Sometimes, to appreciate good film, you need to roll around in the
          bad. These five disasters are essential viewing for any true masochist
          cinephile. So queue them up, pour yourself something strong, and
          embrace the sweet, sweet suffering. After all, what's movie night
          without a little trauma?
